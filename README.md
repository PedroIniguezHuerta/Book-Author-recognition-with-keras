# Book-Author-recognition-with-keras
In this repository I presented a text mining tool for book author recognition using keras. 
This is work in progress work however it provides full code to generate automatically the datasets.
This datasets are ready for feeding machine learnig and deep learning models.
The datasets are created automatically from a list of PDF files containing the books.
